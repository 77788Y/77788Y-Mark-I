# 77788Y-Mark-I

I haven't worked on this code in a while, I don't remember if it's good or not.
It's probably fine I think? 

There's some bad "temporary" code on the tilter that ended
up being less temporary than we'd hoped.

The sine stuff is definitely not the best way to go about acceleration control
but it worked well enough.

Use this at your own risk.
There's probably lots of bad stuff.
But I mean it worked so it can't be that bad right?
